            <h2>Random journal snippits (07/08/2017)</h2>
            <p>[Crows on a rooftop]</p>
            <p>Something about afternoons with no direction.  The sound of singing, views from the fifth floor of the wind in the trees and a man sweeping leaves from the sidewalk.  The rooftops of temples.  Life below and so many different people, every shape and size, every direction.  It's impossibly infinite.  Moments of "must not think" where you melt into the whole of every color and sound and movement being an extension of yourself.  No assigning, no processing, just being.  I like this balcony.  I like this place.  I like these people and this feeling  Coming to terms with where I am:  The fear of loss, clinging to the good, all of it is a sign of not living in the present.  Worry of the future taking place in the now, <i>distracting</i> from the now.  It draws the mind on a goose chase between past, present, future.  The future does not exist, nor does the past, for they only exist here in the present.  Be here in this moment.  Enjoy it, revel in it, then let it go.</p>

              <p>I never imagined my life would come to a point where I'd be eating grilled chicken off a stick while sitting outside a 7-11 at 10 PM on a Tuesday, but here we are.  Life is still full of surprises.</p>

              <h2>Even <i>more</i> snippits(07/09/2018)</h2>
              <p>Existing in the in-between where I'm not exactly an American, but not quite an expat either.  Not Thai, but definitely still an outsider.  Not a tourist.  Not an office worker.  I know 500 ways to describe what I'm <i>not</i>, but none fit who or what I am either.  Some sort of uncharted territory.  This whole job is the art of missing the mark, of finding 99 ways to spectacularly fail at an English camp, or a health lesson, or properly making merit at the temple.  Occasionally you do find those miraculous moments of intersection where Thai and American overlap and we have success and understanding instead of frustration.  It's a beautiful lesson in patience, in trusting the process over the solution.</p>
