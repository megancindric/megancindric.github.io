            <p>A bit about me:</p>
            <p>I'm the kind of person who pays for parking on a Sunday</p>
            <p>Eventually I'd like to turn this page into collections of stories and old blog posts.  I've got a lot of good stories to tell, even if I've only lived a quarter of my life.  One time I broke my pinki halfway through a 2-week canoeing trip and <i>still</i> finished the trip.  Another time I adopted a stray cat from a market in Thailand and named him McLovin.  Once our bus broke down 2 hours into a 12 hour trip to Bangkok (with no air conditioning!).  I've gone from Madison to Thailand to working with Girls Who Code to <i>being</i> a girl who codes. Consider this a rough draft - I'll add in the rest some day.</p>

                <p>Would you believe me if I told you I met this elephant <i>three</i> separate times?  The owners of the sanctuary were from <i>Issan</i>, the region I lived in Thailand.  We became fast friends, and it was my go-to place to take friends and family that came to visit me.  For as massive as they are, elephants really are quite friendly.  This one was named Dtao, which means star.</p>

                <p>Thailand is hot.  Like, 100% humidity, so-hot-you-can't-sleep, hellfire kind of hot.  So what do you do when it's peak summer heat and school's out?  Why, have a nation-wide water festival, of course!</p>
